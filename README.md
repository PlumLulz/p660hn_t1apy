# p660hn_t1apy
Keygen for p660hn-t1a with a SSID of ZyXELddddlll

Not for the p660n-t1a (close but some weird capitalization)\
Nor the AMG1202-T10A and AMG1302-T10A that have a similar SSID.\
Also not the Irish Eircom models\
Thanks to dev-zzo for his router tools that allow the extraction of the RasCode from the firmware. https://github.com/dev-zzo/router-tools

Usage: python3 p660hn_t1a.py 5067F0EB2860
